                I am a <b>full stack engineer</b> who is passionate about building beautiful interfaces and experiences. I recently graduated from Rithm School's full-stack web development program in San Francisco, specializing in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>relational databses</strong>.
              </div>

              <div className="mt-3">
                Prior to attending Rithm School, I graduated from <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> in the fall of 2019, with a major in <strong>Economics</strong> and a <strong>Certificate in Technology Entrepreneurship from College of Engineering</strong>. By being involved in many start-up projects and making the finalist at the Collider Cup, the biggest start-up competition at Berkeley, I became an adaptive learner who can perform excellently in a fast-paced environment and under pressure. In addition, Iâ€™ve served in the Korean Army as a <b>Special Task Force commander</b>, where I supervised a high-performance team of 12 for Counter-terrorism operations to protect Seoul. Serving in the Army has developed me into a proactive leader who will always seek to deliver more results than requested.

              <div className="mt-3">
                By combining my ability to write <b>modern</b>, <b>performant</b>, and <b>robust</b> code with my past professional experience and the understanding of business, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization and bring refreshing perspectives and inputs.

                <b>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</b>, I would practice boxing, go on road trips, jump rope, go for a run near the Bay Bridge, work on calisthenic movements and eat Korean BBQ afterward.
